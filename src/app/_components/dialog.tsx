                <ul className="list-disc list-inside px-8">
                    <li>First, you state the lowest price at which you are willing to sell the bet.</li>
                    <li>Our algorithm randomly generates a buying price between the lowest and highest amount that the bet offers. Random generation guarantees that, with positive probability, the buying price can be any number in this range.</li>
                    <li>If the buying price generated by our algorithm is greater than or equal to the lowest selling price you stated, your bet will be sold at the price generated by the algorithm, and you will earn that amount.</li>
                    <li>If the buying price generated by our algorithm is less than the lowest selling price you stated, your bet will not be sold. If so, you will play the bet and earn the amount that it yields. That is, a ball will be randomly drawn from the associated urn, and you will earn the amount that the bet offers based on its color.</li>
